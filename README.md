# Hi there 👋

I'm [Rajbir](https://rajbirjohar.com). I want to make the web a beautiful place. 

I am a Junior at the University of California, Riverside studying Computer Science. But my real passion lies in frontend web development. Currently, I am working on [Citrushack](https://citrushack.com), the largest hackathon my university has to offer. Feel free to join! 

If I'm not coding, you can catch me perfecting the art of the grilled cheese 🥪 or building bespoke keyboards ⌨️. Gotta invest in your tool of trade, am I right? I'm typing on my Iron165 (my favorite board ever) with lubricated cream switches.

Some cool facts about me:

- My favorite song is [Unshaken](https://open.spotify.com/track/3okk47CKOqAm1TXmVPzNYf?si=dEPGSqzuSX-OXYvY_BpHyw) by D'Angelo.
- My favorite movie is [Interstellar](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/).

I'm always up for a conversation, especially about any of these topics so feel free to hit me up. 🤙
